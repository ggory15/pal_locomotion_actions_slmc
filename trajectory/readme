[t, contact_state]

Note:
contact_state takes value from {1, 0, -1}
1: left support
0: double support
-1: right support


all the trajectory are interpolated at 1000 Hz.
all the trajectory corresponds to motion of stepping in place with four phases [DS, LS, RS, DS], 1.0 second duration for each phase.
contact_state_trajectory has slightly more rows than other trajectories, but any row of it is consistent with other trajectories.
